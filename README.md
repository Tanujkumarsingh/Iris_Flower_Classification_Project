Iris Flower Classification
This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
The model uses a Random Forest Classifier to make predictions and evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Objectives
Preprocess and explore the iris dataset.
Visualize relationships between features using pairplots and heatmaps.
Apply feature selection to identify the most important features.
Train a Random Forest Classifier and evaluate its performance.
Analyze feature importance to understand model predictions.

Files
Main script that loads the dataset, processes it, trains the model, and evaluates performance.
Python dependencies required for the project.

Results
The Random Forest Classifier achieves high accuracy in classifying the iris species, with petal length and petal width being the most important features for classification.
